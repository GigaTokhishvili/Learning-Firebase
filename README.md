# For users: 
On this specific website users can only resize the images.
Users can't log in and out and cant upload images. 
Ive intentionally limited the number of accounts that can register to 2 and both of those are mine.

# What I learned: 
1. Uploading, fetching, deleting images on firebase;
2. Authentication and how to set it up;
3. How to give special rights to authenticated users;
4. How to use react resizable;
